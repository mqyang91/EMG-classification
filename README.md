# EMG-classification
Classification of Gestures from Electromyography Signal  
It introduced a methodology to make the classification of gestures from EMG signals:  
first: the pre-processing method for de-noising and eliminating possible artifacts via wavelet function,  
and second: the EMG signals are extracted to construct a feature matrix, and machine learning methods are used to classify the gestures from the data,  
Finally, compares various algorithms in terms of classification performance to explore the best classifiers for the classification and prediction of the gestures from the EMG data.
